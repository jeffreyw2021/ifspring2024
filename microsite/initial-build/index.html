                            Dune is a 1965 epic science fiction novel by American author Frank Herbert, originally
                            published
                            as
                            two separate serials (1963-64 novel 'Dune World' and 1965 novel 'Prophet of Dune')
                            in Analog magazine. It tied with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award for Best
                            Novel
                            and
                            won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1966. It is the first installment of the
                            Dune
                            Chronicles. It is one of the world's best-selling science fiction novels.

                            Dune is set in the distant future in a feudal interstellar society in which various noble
                            houses
                            control planetary fiefs. It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the
                            stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely
                            populated
                            desert
                            wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or "spice", a drug that extends life and
                            enhances
                            mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of
                            multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be
                            produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story
                            explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human
                            emotion
                            as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis
                            and
                            its
                            spice.

                            Herbert wrote five sequels: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of
                            Dune,
                            and Chapterhouse: Dune. Following Herbert's death in 1986, his son Brian Herbert and author
                            Kevin J.
                            Anderson continued the series in over a dozen additional novels since 1999.

                            Adaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult and complicated. In the
                            1970s,
                            cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to make a film based on the novel. After three
                            years
                            of development, the project was canceled due to a constantly growing budget. In 1984, a film
                            adaptation directed by David Lynch was released to mostly negative responses from critics
                            and
                            failure at the box office, although it later developed a cult following. The book was also
                            adapted
                            into the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune and its 2003 sequel, Frank
                            Herbert's
                            Children of Dune (the latter of which combines the events of Dune Messiah and Children of
                            Dune).
                            A
                            second film adaptation, directed by Denis Villeneuve, was released on October 21, 2021, to
                            positive
                            reviews. It grossed $434 million worldwide and went on to be nominated for ten Academy
                            Awards,
                            including Best Picture, ultimately winning six. Villeneuve's film covers roughly the first
                            half
                            of
                            the original novel; a sequel, which covers the second half of the story, was released on
                            March
                            1,
                            2024, to critical acclaim.

                            The series has also been used as the basis for several board, role-playing, and video games.

                        <p>Since 2009, the names of planets from the Dune novels have been adopted for the real-life
                            nomenclature of plains and other features on Saturn's moon Titan.
