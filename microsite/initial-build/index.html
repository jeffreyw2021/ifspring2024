                            Dune is a 1965 epic science fiction novel by American author Frank Herbert, originally
                            published
                            as
                            two separate serials (1963-64 novel 'Dune World' and 1965 novel 'Prophet of Dune')
                            in Analog magazine. It tied with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award for Best
                            Novel
                            and
                            won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1966. It is the first installment of the
                            Dune
                            Chronicles. It is one of the world's best-selling science fiction novels.

                            Dune is set in the distant future in a feudal interstellar society in which various noble
                            houses
                            control planetary fiefs. It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the
                            stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely
                            populated
                            desert
                            wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or "spice", a drug that extends life and
                            enhances
                            mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of
                            multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be
                            produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story
                            explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human
                            emotion
                            as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis
                            and
                            its
                            spice.

                            Herbert wrote five sequels: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of
                            Dune,
                            and Chapterhouse: Dune. Following Herbert's death in 1986, his son Brian Herbert and author
                            Kevin J.
                            Anderson continued the series in over a dozen additional novels since 1999.

                            Adaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult and complicated. In the
                            1970s,
                            cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to make a film based on the novel. After three
                            years
                            of development, the project was canceled due to a constantly growing budget. In 1984, a film
                            adaptation directed by David Lynch was released to mostly negative responses from critics
                            and
                            failure at the box office, although it later developed a cult following. The book was also
                            adapted
                            into the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune and its 2003 sequel, Frank
                            Herbert's
                            Children of Dune (the latter of which combines the events of Dune Messiah and Children of
                            Dune).
                            A
                            second film adaptation, directed by Denis Villeneuve, was released on October 21, 2021, to
                            positive
                            reviews. It grossed $434 million worldwide and went on to be nominated for ten Academy
                            Awards,
                            including Best Picture, ultimately winning six. Villeneuve's film covers roughly the first
                            half
                            of
                            the original novel; a sequel, which covers the second half of the story, was released on
                            March
                            1,
                            2024, to critical acclaim.

                            The series has also been used as the basis for several board, role-playing, and video games.

                            After his novel The Dragon in the Sea was published in 1957, Herbert traveled to Florence,
                            Oregon, at the north end of the Oregon Dunes. Here, the United States Department of
                            Agriculture was attempting to use poverty grasses to stabilize the sand dunes. Herbert
                            claimed in a letter to his literary agent, Lurton Blassingame, that the moving dunes could
                            "swallow whole cities, lakes, rivers, highways." Herbert's article on the dunes, "They
                            Stopped the Moving Sands", was never completed (and only published decades later in The Road
                            to Dune), but its research sparked Herbert's interest in ecology and deserts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Herbert further drew inspiration from Native American mentors like "Indian Henry" (as
                            Herbert referred to the man to his son; likely a Henry Martin of the Hoh tribe) and Howard
                            Hansen. Both Martin and Hansen grew up on the Quileute reservation near Herbert's hometown.
                            According to historian Daniel Immerwahr, Hansen regularly shared his writing with Herbert.
                            "White men are eating the earth," Hansen told Herbert in 1958, after sharing a piece on the
                            effect of logging on the Quileute reservation. "They're gonna turn this whole planet into a
                            wasteland, just like North Africa." The world could become a "big dune," Herbert responded
                            in agreement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Herbert was also interested in the idea of the superhero mystique and messiahs. He believed
                            that feudalism was a natural condition humans fell into, where some led and others gave up
                            the responsibility of making decisions and just followed orders. He found that desert
                            environments have historically given birth to several major religions with messianic
                            impulses. He decided to join his interests together so he could play religious and
                            ecological ideas against each other. In addition, he was influenced by the story of T. E.
                            Lawrence and the "messianic overtones" in Lawrence's involvement in the Arab Revolt during
                            World War I. In an early version of Dune, the hero was actually very similar to Lawrence of
                            Arabia, but Herbert decided the plot was too straightforward and added more layers to his
                            story.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Herbert drew heavy inspiration also from Lesley Blanch's The Sabres of Paradise (1960), a
                            narrative history recounting a mid-19th century conflict in the Caucasus between rugged
                            caucasian Muslim tribes and the expanding Russian Empire.[7] Language used on both sides of
                            that conflict become terms in Herbert's world—chakobsa, a Caucasian hunting language,
                            becomes a battle language of humans spread across the galaxy; kanly, a word for blood feud
                            in the 19th century Caucasus, represents a feud between Dune's noble Houses; sietch and
                            tabir are both words for camp borrowed from Ukrainian Cossacks (of the Pontic–Caspian
                            steppe).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Herbert also borrowed some lines which Blanch stated were Caucasian proverbs. "To kill with
                            the point lacked artistry", used by Blanch to describe the Caucasus peoples' love of
                            swordsmanship, becomes in Dune "Killing with the tip lacks artistry", a piece of advice
                            given to a young Paul during his training. "Polish comes from the city, wisdom from the
                            hills", a Caucasian aphorism, turns into a desert expression: "Polish comes from the cities,
                            wisdom from the desert".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another significant source of inspiration for Dune was Herbert's experiences with psilocybin
                            and his hobby of cultivating mushrooms, according to mycologist Paul Stamets's account of
                            meeting Herbert in the 1980s:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Frank went on to tell me that much of the premise of Dune—the magic spice (spores) that
                            allowed the bending of space (tripping), the giant sand worms (maggots digesting mushrooms),
                            the eyes of the Fremen (the cerulean blue of Psilocybe mushrooms), the mysticism of the
                            female spiritual warriors, the Bene Gesserits (influenced by the tales of Maria Sabina and
                            the sacred mushroom cults of Mexico)—came from his perception of the fungal life cycle, and
                            his imagination was stimulated through his experiences with the use of magic mushrooms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Herbert spent the next five years researching, writing, and revising. He published a
                            three-part serial Dune World in the monthly Analog, from December 1963 to February 1964. The
                            serial was accompanied by several illustrations that were not published again. After an
                            interval of a year, he published the much slower-paced five-part The Prophet of Dune in the
                            January–May 1965 issues. The first serial became "Book One: Dune" in the final
                            published Dune novel, and the second serial was divided into "Book Two: Muad'dib" and "Book
                            Three: The Prophet". The serialized version was expanded, reworked, and submitted to more
                            than twenty publishers, each of whom rejected it. The novel, Dune, was finally accepted and
                            published in August 1965 by Chilton Books, a printing house better known for publishing auto
                            repair manuals. Sterling Lanier, an editor at Chilton, had seen Herbert's manuscript and
                            had urged his company to take a risk in publishing the book. However, the first printing,
                            priced at $5.95 (equivalent to $57.53 in 2023), did not sell well and was poorly received by
                            critics as being atypical of science fiction at the time. Chilton considered the publication
                            of Dune a write-off and Lanier was fired. Over the course of time, the book gained
                            critical acclaim, and its popularity spread by word-of-mouth to allow Herbert to start
                            working full time on developing the sequels to Dune, elements of which were already written
                            alongside Dune.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At first Herbert considered using Mars as setting for his novel, but eventually decided to
                            use a fictional planet instead. His son Brian said that "Readers would have too many
                            preconceived ideas about that planet, due to the number of stories that had been written
                            about it."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Herbert dedicated his work "to the people whose labors go beyond ideas into the realm of
                            'real materials'—to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they
                            work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration."

                            Duke Leto Atreides of House Atreides, ruler of the ocean world Caladan, is assigned by
                            the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to serve as fief ruler of the planet Arrakis. Although
                            Arrakis is a harsh and inhospitable desert planet, it is of enormous importance because it
                            is the only planetary source of melange, or the "spice", a unique and incredibly valuable
                            substance that extends human youth, vitality and lifespan. It is also through the
                            consumption of spice that Spacing Guild Navigators are able to effect safe interstellar
                            travel. Shaddam, jealous of Duke Leto Atreides's rising popularity in the Landsraad, sees
                            House Atreides as a potential future rival and threat, so conspires with House Harkonnen,
                            the former stewards of Arrakis and the longstanding enemies of House Atreides, to destroy
                            Leto and his family after their arrival. Leto is aware his assignment is a trap of some
                            kind, but is compelled to obey the Emperor's orders anyway.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Leto's concubine Lady Jessica is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit, an exclusively female
                            group that pursues mysterious political aims and wields seemingly superhuman physical and
                            mental abilities, such as the ability to control their bodies down to the cellular level,
                            and also decide the sex of their children. Though Jessica was instructed by the Bene
                            Gesserit to bear a daughter as part of their breeding program, out of love for Leto she bore
                            a son, Paul. From a young age, Paul is trained in warfare by Leto's aides, the elite
                            soldiers Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck. Thufir Hawat, the Duke's Mentat (human computers,
                            able to store vast amounts of data and perform advanced calculations on demand), has
                            instructed Paul in the ways of political intrigue. Jessica has also trained her son in Bene
                            Gesserit disciplines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Paul's prophetic dreams interest Jessica's superior, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam.
                            She subjects Paul to a deadly test. This involves her holding a poisoned needle (the gom
                            jabbar) to his neck, ready to strike should he withdraw his hand from a box which creates
                            extreme pain by nerve induction but causes no physical damage. This is to test Paul's
                            ability to endure the pain so as not to die on the tip of the needle; to confirm that his
                            human strengths can overcome his animal instincts. Paul passes by enduring greater pain than
                            any woman who has ever been subjected to the test.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Leto, Jessica, and Paul travel with their household to occupy Arrakeen, the capital on
                            Arrakis formerly held by House Harkonnen. Leto learns of the dangers involved in harvesting
                            the spice, which is protected by giant sandworms, and seeks to negotiate with the planet's
                            indigenous Fremen people, seeing them as a valuable ally rather than foes. Soon after the
                            Atreides' arrival, Harkonnen forces attack, joined by the Emperor's ferocious Sardaukar
                            troops in disguise. Leto is betrayed by his personal physician, the Suk doctor Wellington
                            Yueh, who delivers a drugged Leto to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and his twisted Mentat,
                            Piter De Vries. Yueh, who performed the kidnapping of Leto under duress, arranges for
                            Jessica and Paul to escape into the desert, where they are presumed dead by the Harkonnens.
                            Yueh replaces one of Leto's teeth with a poison gas capsule, hoping Leto can kill the Baron
                            during their encounter. The Baron narrowly avoids the gas (due to his shield), which kills
                            Leto, Piter, and the others in the room. The Baron forces Hawat to take over Piter's
                            position by dosing him with a long-lasting, fatal poison and threatening to withhold the
                            regular antidote doses unless he obeys. While he follows the Baron's orders, Hawat works
                            secretly to undermine the Harkonnens.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Having fled into the desert, Paul is exposed to high concentrations of spice and has visions
                            through which he realizes he has significant powers (as a result of the Bene Gesserit
                            breeding scheme). He foresees potential futures in which he lives among the planet's native
                            Fremen before leading them on a Holy Jihad across the known universe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is revealed Jessica is the daughter of Baron Harkonnen, a secret kept from her by the
                            Bene Gesserit. After being captured by Fremen, Paul and Jessica are accepted into the Fremen
                            community of Sietch Tabr, and teach the Fremen the Bene Gesserit fighting technique known to
                            the Fremen as the "weirding way". Paul proves his manhood by killing a Fremen named Jamis in
                            a ritualistic crysknife fight and chooses the Fremen name Muad'Dib, while Jessica opts to
                            undergo a ritual to become a Reverend Mother by drinking the poisonous Water of Life.
                            Pregnant with Leto's daughter, she inadvertently causes the unborn child, Alia, to become
                            infused with the same powers in the womb. Paul takes a Fremen lover, Chani who bears him a
                            son, Leto.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Two years pass and Paul's powerful prescience manifests, which confirms for the Fremen that
                            he is their prophesied messiah, a legend planted by the Bene Gesserit's Missionaria
                            Protectiva. Paul embraces his father's belief that the Fremen could be a powerful fighting
                            force to take back Arrakis, but also sees that if he does not control them, their jihad
                            could consume the entire universe. Word of the new Fremen leader reaches both Baron
                            Harkonnen and the Emperor as spice production falls due to their increasingly destructive
                            raids. The Baron encourages his brutish nephew Glossu Rabban to rule with an iron fist,
                            hoping the contrast with his shrewder nephew Feyd-Rautha will make the latter popular among
                            the people of Arrakis when he eventually replaces Rabban. The Emperor, suspecting the Baron
                            of trying to create troops more powerful than the Sardaukar to seize power, sends spies to
                            monitor activity on Arrakis. Hawat uses the opportunity to sow seeds of doubt in the Baron
                            about the Emperor's true plans, putting further strain on their alliance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Gurney, who survived the Harkonnen coup and became a smuggler, reunites with Paul and
                            Jessica after a Fremen raid on his harvester. Believing Jessica to be the traitor, Gurney
                            threatens to kill her, but is stopped by Paul. Paul did not foresee Gurney's attack, and
                            concludes he must increase his prescience by drinking the Water of Life, which is
                            traditionally fatal to males. Paul falls into unconsciousness for three weeks after drinking
                            the poison, but when he wakes, he has clairvoyance across time and space: he is the Kwisatz
                            Haderach, the ultimate goal of the Bene Gesserit breeding program.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Paul senses the Emperor and Baron are amassing fleets around Arrakis to quell the Fremen
                            rebellion, and prepares the Fremen for a major offensive against the Harkonnen troops. The
                            Emperor arrives with the Baron on Arrakis. The Emperor's troops seize a Fremen outpost,
                            killing many including young Leto, while Alia is captured and taken to the Emperor. Under
                            cover of an electric storm, which shorts out the Emperor's troops' defensive shields, Paul
                            and the Fremen, riding giant sandworms, destroy the capital's natural rock fortifications
                            with atomics and attack, while Alia assassinates the Baron and escapes. The Fremen quickly
                            defeat both the Harkonnen and Sardaukar troops, killing Rabban in the process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Paul faces the Emperor, threatening to destroy spice production forever unless Shaddam
                            abdicates the throne. Feyd-Rautha attempts to stop Paul by challenging him to a ritualistic
                            knife fight, during which he attempts to cheat and kill Paul with a poison spur in his belt.
                            Paul gains the upper hand and kills him. The Emperor reluctantly cedes the throne to Paul
                            and promises his daughter Princess Irulan's hand in marriage. As Paul takes control of the
                            Empire, he realizes that while he has achieved his goal, he is no longer able to stop the
                            Fremen jihad, as their belief in him is too powerful to restrain.

                                an aristocratic family that rules the planet Caladan.</p>

                                Jessica is a Bene Gesserit and an
                                important key in the Bene Gesserit breeding program. According to the breeding program,
                                she was to produce a daughter, who would be bred with Feyd-Rautha, a nephew of Baron
                                Vladimir Harkonnen. However, Jessica falls in love with Leto and grants him the son he
                                desires. Although Paul is a boy, Jessica gives him some training in the Bene Gesserit
                                ways, including enhanced observation and the Sisterhood's specialized martial art.
                                Initially described as "small for his age", Paul has secretly undergone the early Mentat
                                training, and is also schooled in weapon use by Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho.

                            <p>Duke Leto Atreides is the planetary governor of the ocean planet Caladan who takes over
                                the lucrative spice mining operations on the desert planet Arrakis at the behest of the
                                Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. </p>
                            <p>
                                Knowing it is some kind of trap but unable to refuse the assignment, Leto proactively
                                seeks an alliance with the native Fremen, people tempered by the planet's harsh
                                conditions who Leto realizes are an underestimated and untapped resource. He is
                                accompanied to Arrakis by his Bene Gesserit concubine Lady Jessica, with whom he is in
                                love but has not married to allow for the possibility of a politically advantageous
                                marriage, and his son and heir, Paul. Threatened by Leto's growing influence among the
                                Landsraad assembly of noble families, Shaddam has aligned himself with Leto's enemy, the
                                Baron Harkonnen. The Harkonnens, secretly bolstered by Shaddam's fierce Sardaukar
                                warriors and aided by Leto's own personal physician, the Suk doctor Wellington Yueh,
                                launch an attack that devastates the Atreides forces. Leto is taken prisoner by the
                                Baron, and dies attempting to kill him.

                            <p>
                                As Dune begins, Jessica is the Bene Gesserit concubine to the Duke Leto Atreides, and
                                mother to his young son and heir Paul. Leto has been granted control of the lucrative
                                planetary fief of Arrakis, and is moving his entire household there from his ocean
                                homeworld of Caladan.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jessica's mentor and former instructor, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen
                                Mohiam, is still furious over Jessica's past insubordination—she had been instructed to
                                bear only daughters but, out of love for Leto, she instead intentionally conceived Paul;
                                Mohiam is somewhat intrigued by the potential she sees in the 15-year-old boy. Still, an
                                Atreides daughter is a crucial part of the Bene Gesserit breeding program to eventually
                                produce a super-being they call the Kwisatz Haderach.

                                Halleck is Paul's weapons teacher, as well as a skilled musician. He is one of
                                Leto's chief officers, and serves alongside Duncan Idaho as a Swordmaster of House
                                Atreides. According to Dune, Gurney was trained by "the best fighters in the
                                universe", and alongside Idaho and Thufir Hawat gave Leto a war council almost
                                unparalleled in the Imperium.
                            </p>

                                He manages to survive the fall of House Atreides on Arrakis with 73 men. In the
                                years after the attack, he falls in with the melange smugglers, eventually becoming
                                a powerful figure. His smugglers fall for a Fremen trap—a fake hoard of spice—and
                                are almost killed before Paul, now the Fremen leader "Muad'Dib", recognizes him.
                                Halleck later becomes Jessica's loyal chief officer after nearly killing her,
                                mistakenly believing she betrayed Duke Leto.

                                At the time of Frank Herbert's original novel Dune (1965), Idaho is a Swordmaster of
                                the Ginaz in the service of House Atreides and one of Duke Leto's right-hand men
                                (with Gurney Halleck and Thufir Hawat). When the Atreides take over the planet
                                Arrakis at the order of the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, Idaho becomes Leto's
                                ambassador to the Fremen, the desert people of Dune that Leto hopes will ally with
                                him in the coming war against the Emperor and the Harkonnens.

                                Idaho goes to live with the Fremen, serving both Leto and Fremen leader Stilgar.
                                When the Emperor's dreaded Sardaukar attack Arrakis in the guise of Harkonnen
                                troops, Idaho initially survives the assault and saves Leto's son Paul Atreides and
                                concubine Lady Jessica. When they are cornered at a Botanical Testing Station, Paul
                                and Jessica flee while Idaho holds off the enemy, but he is ultimately killed.
