        <li>
            <p>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</p>
            <p>My name is Jeffrey Wang, currently a Junior majoring in Computer Science and Communication Design.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</p>
            <p>I've been working as a frontend developer mostly using React for web or React Native for mobile apps, and
                this class seems to be a good chance for me to delve deeper into design thinking in UI development with
                basic html + css techniques. Also it satifies my major requirement for ComDes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</p>
            <p>Yes, HTML/CSS/JS comes in handy for me when it comes to web dev. It's been some time since I've worked
                with their vanilla versions, so I'm looking forward to reacquainting myself with them through this
                course.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</p>
            <P> I hope to learn more about user-centric design principles and how to apply them effectively in web
                development. Understanding the nuances of creating user-friendly and accessible interfaces is a skill I
                wish to hone.</P>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</p>
            <p>Per my understanding, designing for screen is different from designing for paper in that it involves
                dynamic and interactive elements, providing opportunities for engaging user interactions and animated
                elements. This requires a careful balance of functionality, scalability, and aesthetics, considering the
                diverse range of devices and screen sizes, as well as the services and data in the backend that can be
                constantly change.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</p>
            <p>An example of effective design is Airbnb's website: <a
                    href="https://www.airbnb.com">https://www.airbnb.com</a>. It's intuitive, visually appealing, and
                its user interface guides visitors smoothly through the process of finding and booking accommodations,
                reflecting a strong understanding of user experience.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</p>
            <p>For me it will definitely be <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">https://www.wikipedia.org</a>. While the
                webpage may not have been praised in terms of aesthetics, it does an outstanding job it terms of clear
                communication of a massive amount of information, while adapting strictly to html5 standards to allow
                compatibility with a variety of devices and browsers, ensuring its access to users all across the
                world.An excellent example of effective communication in web design and development.</p>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</p>
            <p>Apple's website <a href="https://www.apple.com">(https://www.apple.com)</a> is a standout for its
                successful brand-building and aesthetic design. It mirrors Apple's identity of sleek innovation and
                user-focus, displaying products with high-quality visuals and interactive features that highlight both
                their beauty and functionality.</p>
