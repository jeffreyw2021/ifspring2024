                <p class="stepTitle">Hamburger Patties:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix together the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, seasoning salt, garlic powder, and black
                        pepper
                        in a
                        large bowl.</li>
                    <li>Start forming it into patties by grabbing a handful of meat and rolling it into a ball. Then
                        press
                        down
                        to flatten it out. Smooth the edges so there isn't any cracks or jagged edges. Patties should
                        come
                        out
                        to at least one inch thick. Try to keep the patties large since it will shrink when fried.</li>
                    <li>Heat a pan over medium heat. Fry each side of the patties for about 3-5 minutes or until well
                        done.
                    </li>
                    <li>Set each finished patty on a plate lined with paper towel to catch any extra grease.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Mix together the beef stock, shoyu, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, and cornstarch. Whisk it
                        until
                        the
                        cornstarch has come off of the bottom.</li>
                    <li>Using the same pan, melt one tablespoon of the butter to caramelize the onions for about a
                        minute
                        then
                        fry the mushrooms for another minute or two. (It is optional to add the mushrooms and onions. If
                        not,
                        just skip to the next step.)</li>
                    <li>Melt the rest of the butter and add in the gravy mix to the pan. Keep stirring the gravy until
                        it
                        begins
                        to thicken and simmer.</li>
